## ‚úñÔ∏è Attention

### GPU
* Unfortunately, Apple doesn't use Intel GM45 Chipset on their Mac. But luckily, insanelymac community had do it by using GMAX3100 kext to fake their GPU.
 * Here is list of MacOS X supported:
   * MacOS X Tiger & Snow Leopard: Native resolution + QE/CI.
   * MacOS X Lion & Mountain Lion: Native resolution + CI. QE work but it have a little bit of lag.
   * MacOS X Mavericks: Custom resolution on Chameleon Bootloader. QE work but it have a little big of lag.
   * MacOS X Yosemite: Apple had fixed. That mean when you custom resolution, QE will not worked.

### Sleep, Wake and Hibernation
* Sleep and Wake doesn't work. I don't know why but when i run this laptop into sleep mode, it will show a black picture and cursor.
* Hibernation will not work on any Hackintosh computer so you shouldn't hope fix this.

### iMessage/Facetime and App Store
* AppStore will work if you have an internet connection.
* For Facetime & iMessage, follow this <a href="https://github.com/red-toxic/iMessage-Fix/">guide</a>.
