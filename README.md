* R-Drive Image to create USB boot.
  * After the create USB done, go to your Bios

* Press F2 when computer restart to go to Bios
* Config like this

* Tab Advanced:
  * Intel(R) Virtualization: Disable

* Tab Boot:
  * External Device Boot: Enable
  * Select 1st Boot Priority: External Device

## Installation (For newbie)
* If it notify you about bluetooth connection, just press 'SpaceBar'.
* Press Continue until you see the list of disk to install.
* Go to Utilities -> Disk Utility and format it in 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)'.
* Close it and install MacOS X to your formatted disk.

## üîì Kext
This is my kext for my system. You can download & install from this github page but i'm not sure about the compatible on your computer. I will show all infomation about this kext with my computer and also i will explain these kext too.

* ‚ö† Caution: On folder kext there was a folder name 'App' which already have 'Kext Utility'. Extract it and using it to install kext.

### Audio
* Install VoodooHDA.kext
* After install it will inject all port (Speaker, Headphone)
* VoodooHDA_Loader will auto install after you install this kext and reboot. If VoodooHDA_Loader doesn't show on 'System Configurator', you can install it from HackintoshVietNamTool by click this: Kext/Sound/VoodooHDA and install.
* Using CodecCommander.kext if you want to fix sound when sleep/wake.

### Wifi & Bluetooth
* ‚ö† Attention: Intel AGN 5100 is not supported.
* My wifi is working well but bluetooth is not (Atheros 9285). But some time is doesn't work well. So install IOath3kfrmwr.kext and AtherosWiFiInjector.kext to have native Wifi & Bluetoothh. Also you have to use FakePCIID_AR9280_as_AR946x.kext and FakePCIID.kext to have AirPort too.

### Enthernet
* There is no kext for this so you have to change to Wireless.

### CPU
* Using FakeSMC.kext and FakeSMC_CPUSensors.kext to make CPU working. Also using NullCPUPowerManagement.kext to prevent Kernel Panic.
* To reduce battery drain, using DisableTurboBoostBattery.kext to make Hackintosh automatically adjust CPU clock.

### GPU
* Unfortunately, Apple doesn't use Intel GM45 Chipset on their Mac. But luckily, insanelymac community had do it by using GMAX3100 kext to fake their GPU.
 * Here is list of MacOS X supported:
   * MacOS X Tiger & Snow Leopard: Native resolution + QE/CI.
   * MacOS X Lion & Mountain Lion: Native resolution + CI. QE work but it have a little bit of lag.
   * MacOS X Mavericks: Custom resolution on Chameleon Bootloader. QE work but it have a little big of lag.
   * MacOS X Yosemite: Apple had fixed. That mean when you custom resolution, QE will not worked.

### Sleep, Wake and Hibernation
* Sleep and Wake doesn't work. I don't know why but when i run this laptop into sleep mode, it will show a black picture and cursor.
* Hibernation will not work on any Hackintosh computer so you shouldn't hope fix this.

### iMessage/Facetime and App Store
* AppStore will work if you have an internet connection.
* For Facetime & iMessage, i will have a guide later.

### Battery
* Using ACPIBatteryManager.kext to have native battery percent.

* VoodooPS2Controller.kext will inject and active touchpad.

### Other
